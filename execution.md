## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Scanner failures**: Implement robust error handling
- **SSRF attacks**: NetworkGuard validation
- **Payment failures**: Stripe webhook retry logic
- **Queue delays**: Laravel Cloud auto-scaling

### Business Risks
- **Low conversion**: 14-day trial optimization
- **High churn**: Focus on value delivery
- **Support burden**: Comprehensive documentation

## Timeline Summary

**Total Duration**: 22 days

- **Week 1**: Foundation, Scanners, Queue
- **Week 2**: Domain Management, Dashboard, Billing
- **Week 3**: Reporting, Testing, Support & Engagement Systems
- **Final Days**: Deployment, Polish & Launch

## Next Steps

1. Initialize Laravel project with React starter kit
2. Set up development environment
3. Create database migrations
4. Begin scanner implementation
5. Follow phase progression

This execution plan provides a clear path from empty directory to production-ready Achilleus MVP in 21 days.
